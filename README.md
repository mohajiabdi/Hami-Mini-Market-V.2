# 🛍️ Hami MiniMarket Product Catalog
## 🌐 Project Overview

The Hami MiniMarket Product Catalog is the Week 2 project for the HamiSkills Web Development Internship Track.
It extends the previous landing page by adding a dynamic and responsive product catalog that allows users to search and filter products by name, category, and price range.

This project simulates a small-scale e-commerce product listing system, helping me practice JavaScript DOM manipulation, filter logic, and responsive UI layouts.


## 🎯 Project Purpose

The goal of this project is to build a functional product catalog where customers can:

Browse fruits and vegetables

Search products by name

Filter items by category or price

Interact with an easy-to-use, mobile-friendly design

## 🧱 Features

Display of at least 8 products (name, image, price, and category)

🔍 Search bar for real-time product filtering by name

🏷️ Category filter using buttons or dropdown (Fruits, Vegetables)

💰 Price filter to show products below a selected range

🛒 Optional Add to Cart button and cart counter

📱 Responsive design for desktop, tablet, and mobile

💡 Interactive JavaScript functionality for searching, filtering, and updating content dynamically

💬 Learning Reflection

Through this project, I practiced building a responsive and visually appealing webpage using core web technologies.
It improved my understanding of semantic HTML, CSS Grid/Flexbox layouts, and basic JavaScript interactions.
